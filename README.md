# Data Structures Collection

Welcome to my collection of data structures! This repository contains implementations of various data structures, showcasing their applications in solving problems more efficiently. Throughout my first year of university, many assignments and labs focused on exploring and implementing these structures.

## Directory Structure

- `.settings`: Configuration settings for the project.
- `Array based Queues`: Implementations and examples of queues based on arrays.
- `Array based lists`: Implementations and examples of lists based on arrays.
- `Array based stacks`: Implementations and examples of stacks based on arrays.
- `Background info`: Initial commit with background information.
- `Data Classes`: Implementations of essential data classes.
- `Data structures created`: Main directory containing the implemented data structures.
- `Different Sorting Algorithms`: Implementations and examples of various sorting algorithms.
- `Hashing and Hash sets`: Implementations and examples of hashing and hash sets.
- `Linked Queues`: Implementations and examples of queues based on linked structures.

## Background Information

This repository is a collection of data structures implemented during my first year of university. The assignments and labs included demonstrate the practical applications of these structures in solving real-world problems more efficiently.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the different directories to understand how each data structure is implemented and utilized. The accompanying examples and assignments provide insights into the practical applications and efficiency gains achieved through the use of these data structures.

## Contribution
